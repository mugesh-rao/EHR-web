# Electronic Healthcare Management System - SRM Hackathon

This project is an **Electronic Healthcare Management System** developed as part of the SRM Hackathon. The system aims to streamline healthcare management by providing an integrated platform for patients, doctors, and administrators to manage medical records, appointments, and other healthcare services. 

## Project Overview

- **Objective**: Create a comprehensive healthcare management system that supports secure medical record management, appointment scheduling, and easy access for both patients and healthcare providers.
- **Technologies Used**:
  - **MERN Stack** (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js)
  - **Blockchain** (for secure medical record management, though this part of the implementation was unsuccessful)
  
## Features

- **Patient Management**: Patients can register, update personal details, and maintain their medical records.
- **Appointment Scheduling**: Patients can book appointments with doctors based on availability.
- **Doctor Dashboard**: Doctors can view their upcoming appointments and patient history.
- **Admin Dashboard**: Admins can manage users, appointments, and overall system settings.
- **UI/UX**: The UI was designed with a focus on usability and visual appeal.

## Blockchain Implementation (Failed)

The initial plan for the project included the use of **blockchain technology** for storing medical records securely. However, due to various challenges, this implementation was unsuccessful, including:

- **Integration Issues**: The integration between the blockchain layer and the MERN stack was not seamless, resulting in failed transactions.
- **Scalability**: Blockchain was not able to handle large amounts of data in the required manner for this project, leading to performance bottlenecks.
- **Security Concerns**: While blockchain is secure, the complexity of integrating it with a real-world healthcare management system posed challenges in terms of ensuring data integrity and privacy.
  
As a result, the blockchain feature was removed from the final prototype.

## Final Prototype

Despite the blockchain setbacks, the **final prototype** was successfully built using the **MERN stack**, with a **great UI** that provides a seamless experience for the users. The following features were implemented:

- **React** for the front-end with a responsive and modern user interface.
- **Node.js and Express** for the back-end, handling APIs for patient and doctor management.
- **MongoDB** for storing user data, medical records, and appointment details.
